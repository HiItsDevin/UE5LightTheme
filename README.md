# UE5LightTheme
 An attempt at making a light theme for UE5, mainly so my eyes don't need to strain and have migraines due to Dark Theme. **This theme is not fully finished and will be changed around during UE5's development.**

# Prerequisites
Just make sure your UE5 is completely closed while doing this, otherwise the theme will not show up in the Engine until restarted.

# How to install
Click on the green "Code" and then Download ZIP. After it's downloaded it, extract the ZIP anywhere. Go to where your UE5 is located, typically that's in `C:\Program Files\Epic Games`. Now go to `UE_5.0EA\Engine\Content\Slate\Themes`, and drop the Attempted Light Theme JSON into there, should look like this

> Note: As of Release version of Unreal Engine 5, the `Themes` folder doesn't exist by default. You can still create a `Themes` folder and it will still work!

After that, you launch Unreal Engine 5, and load up any project, and then click on Edit on the top bar, Editor Preferences, go to General - Appearance, and for Active Theme, set from "Dark" to "Attempted Light Theme"

Feel free to edit the theme to your liking.
